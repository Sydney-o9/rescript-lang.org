# Installation

Prerequisite: NPM, which comes with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/). [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) also works.

To install ReScript globally:

```sh
npm install -g bs-platform
```

## New Project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rescript-lang/new-project
cd new-project
npm install
npm run build
node src/Demo.bs.js
```

<!-- TODO: rescript template -->

That compiles your ReScript into JavaScript, then uses NodeJS to run said JavaScript. **We recommend you use our highly unique workflow of keeping a tab open for the generated `.bs.js` file**, so that you can learn how ReScript transforms to JavaScript. Not many languages output clean JavaScript code you can manually inspect!

During development, instead of running `npm run build` each time to compile, use `npm run start` to start a watcher that recompiles automatically after file changes.

Alternatively, **to start a [ReasonReact](/docs/reason-react/latest/introduction) app**, follow the instructions [here](/docs/reason-react/latest/installation).

## Integrate Into Existing JS Project

You can install the toolchain locally to an existing JS project, through the familiar command:

```sh
npm install --save-dev bs-platform
```

The rest is the same as above. Since we output clean `.bs.js` files, the rest of your existing toolchain (e.g. Babel and Webpack) should mostly just work. Nothing to learn on the bundling side!
